            Overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer. Back in the days of the living, 
            humans created cyberpunk to more accurately represent the intricacies of baking 
            fresh apple pies (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4Yi5yPyGUU">I mean, wouldn't you?!</a>).

        [Easy] Print a new number by adding one to each of its digit
        Description:
        A number is input in computer then a new no should get printed by adding one to each of its digit. If you encounter a 9, insert a 10 (don't carry over, just shift things around).

        For example, 998 becomes 10109.
        Bonus

        This challenge is trivial to do if you map it to a string to iterate over the input, operate, and then cast it back. Instead, try doing it without casting it as a string at any point, keep it numeric (int, float if you need it) only.
